        <p><em id="highlight">Stress and anxiety is found amongst many students attending a university. </em></p>
        <p>According to BBC, mental health on campus has risen from about 8,000 to 18,000 in the last four years. Studies have been done to examine the stress factors that are causing the students to have anxiety. According to health news, students suffering from stress have an average of a 2.72 GPA while students whom are not suffering from stress have an average of a 3.3 GPA. Research was conducted to acknowledge which stress factor is causing the most anxiety amongst the students at the University of Miami and what can be done to help these individuals control their stress, thus have a better academic performance. </p>
        <p>The counseling center at the University of Miami provides free weekly one hour counseling for its students. There are many trained professionals at the center willing to help students deal with any problems they are facing. The center however, does not collect different statistics based on their patients. Dr. Rene Monteagudo mentions how anxiety and stress is the most common cause for students attending the counseling center. What factors are causing the anxiety and stress in our student body? Is it the academic status, the degree of study, gender, race, or financial and living statuses? </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Consequences Stress May Cause</h3>
        <p>Stress appears differently in each individual. If your body can’t handle a physical or emotional threat, your body releases stress hormones such as cortisol. A constant increase of cortisol increases your body to be at risk for anxiety, depression, mood swings, insomnia, over eating, failing grades, and others. Anxiety is the most common disorder found amongst our students. The more stress a person undergoes, the more cortisol is released throughout the body causing a disruption in one’s quality of life.
